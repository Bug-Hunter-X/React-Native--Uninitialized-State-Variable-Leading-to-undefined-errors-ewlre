# React Native: Uninitialized State Variable

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: using an uninitialized state variable.  The `Bug.js` file shows the problematic code, leading to undefined values being passed to components.  The solution, found in `BugSolution.js`, shows how to properly initialize and handle potential undefined states.

## Problem

Uninitialized state variables can cause unexpected behavior, particularly if components or functions rely on those variables having a defined value.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected rendering issues.

## Solution

The solution involves properly initializing the state with a default value and implementing checks to handle situations where the state might still be undefined during rendering.  Conditional rendering helps avoid errors by only rendering components when the necessary state is available.
